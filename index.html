                Hiya! My name is Dara Yanoff and I'm a student at Wheaton College, Class of 2024. My academic focus is in both Design and Business Management (with a marketing concentration). I am taking this class to learn the tools neccesary to design three dimensional objects in the modern age of technology. This is my first design course, but otherwise I have years of crafting to backup my passion for creation.

            <p class="text">
                This is just to show you that you can also place the picture container to the right of the text. Take a look at the different order of code. You may add to this section, or delete it entirely if you feel you have enough on your home page.
                <br><br>
                You may also notice that the first image of Howie is a vertical orientation whereas the second photo is horizontal. Take a look at the code and the class of each image. The CSS is written such that you specify the orientation of the image to ensure it fills the whole square! You're welcome!
            </p>
            <div class="smallImageDiv right">
                <img class="smallImage horizontal" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/97Co1zfYxM6Bmikv_McozYn0Ng5fiL9o6LJwgLNRomo-i3eJubtc6V0Zsrg1SBWrMsQ=w2400">
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="noImage">
            <p class="text">
                Lastly, this is to show you how to create a section of text with no images. Once again, you may add to this section, or delete it entirely. I can keep typing and typing and typing and the text will automatically create a newline as needed!
